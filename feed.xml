&lt;p&gt;Samsung has announced two new Galaxy phones: the S10 Lite and the Note 10 Lite. “S “and” note “in Samsung language usually mean” really high-end.” These two phones are not the same thing. After spending half an hour studying both of them, I can understand why Samsung made them. But I’m still deeply confused about some of the Samsung decisions made here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">360Hz Gaming Monitor</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/360hz-gaming-monitor.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="360Hz Gaming Monitor" /><published>2020-01-07T00:00:59+03:00</published><updated>2020-01-07T00:00:59+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/360hz-gaming-monitor</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/360hz-gaming-monitor.html">&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pf_k8Lg4dmo?start=48&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great monitor and the high refresh rate is great in fast paced games. The only issue is the ugly stand which is rather large and does take up a lot of desk space, plus the vesa mount on the back is quite recessed so you have to use long screws and spacers to enable attachment of the bracket. Mine also came with no UK plug, if the monitor performance wasn’t really good I would be unhappy but it works great.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to download videos from TikTok?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/how-to-download-tiktok-video.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to download videos from TikTok?" /><published>2020-01-06T19:00:59+03:00</published><updated>2020-01-06T19:00:59+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/how-to-download-tiktok-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/how-to-download-tiktok-video.html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of you know about TikTok by now.
